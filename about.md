<p class="message">
I am currently an undergraduate senior student studying journalism at the University of Iowa also pursing my business certificate in Entrepreneurship. I have been interested in the journalism field from a very young age and for this reason hope to immerse myself into the career after I finish my education at the University of Iowa. 

I have a passion for writing, editing, and expressing my thoughts and known information. I have gained much experience from taking multiple classes for the journalism major and from other writing classes of my choice. I am an active member of the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. I also gained a lot of valuable experience from my internship this summer, at the non-profit organization NEDA. With this, my first internship, I was forced to learn quickly and to adapt. I gained much expertise in editing and conducting blogs, social media messages and preparing populated events.
